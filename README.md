Password Generator

### DESCRIPTION: 
Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### CRITERIA:

* click the button to generate a password
* presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* select which criteria to include in the password
* choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* choose character types: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* generated password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

### DEVELOPMENTS/COMMITS:

* Created vars, functions, if/else for password criteria - criteria prompts working, no password
* Googled how to add items to an array -> .push() - prompts still working, no password
* Googled how to get a string from an array -> .join() - prompts still working, no password
* Search js for inconsistencies - upperCase/upper
* deployed ---prompts working, password generated!!!

### IMPROVEMENTS/QUESTIONS:

* Criteria if/else statements can be condensed but I couldn't figure out how to do it... yet
* Is there a way to get upper case from lower case (or vice versa)?
